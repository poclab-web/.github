# ðŸ§ª POCLab â€“ Chemistry Ã— Informatics

**POC** in PocLab stands for:

- **Passion for Originality and Creativity (Why)** â€“ our driving force  
- **Proof of Concept (How)** â€“ turning ideas into working methods  
- **Physical Organic Chemistry (What)** â€“ our scientific foundation  

We are a research group working at the intersection of **Chemistry and Informatics**,  
aiming to accelerate the discovery and design of new molecules and materials through data-driven approaches.
