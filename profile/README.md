# 🧪 POCLab (Gotoh Lab) – Chemistry × Informatics

📍 Principal Investigator: Hiroaki Gotoh (Associate Professor)

🏫 Yokohama National University, Japan

**🧭 Mission** : **To advance innovative methodologies for molecular and reaction design.**
We tackle the central challenges of chemistry — molecular design and reaction optimization.
Our mission is driven by six core perspectives that redefine how molecules and reactions are discovered, designed, and realized.

**🔍 Vision** : **To build a sustainable future through data-driven science grounded in central chemistry.**
We integrate chemistry with information science to create new value for society.
Our vision is to become a pioneering research hub that catalyzes innovation across multiple domains, including materials, energy, environment, and life sciences.

**⚖️ Value** : **We prioritize proof of concept (PoC) and promote innovative research that unites experiment, computation, and machine learning.**
Through structure-based chemical design thinking and open science, we strive to create a sustainable and collaborative scientific future.

**POC** in PocLab stands for:

- **Passion for Originality and Creativity (Why)** – our driving force  
- **Proof of Concept (How)** – turning ideas into working methods  
- **Physical Organic Chemistry (What)** – our scientific foundation  

We are a research group working at the intersection of **Chemistry and Informatics**,  
aiming to accelerate the discovery and design of new molecules and materials through data-driven approaches.
